                    <small>
                        Ziaullah Khan did his Matric from Habib Public School Karachi. His early academic days do not portray him as a serious student or a leader was in the making. He made various unsuccessful attempts while in DJ Science College in ICMAP. He did his Masters in economic as an external candidate. He got admission in the Arizona State University from where he did his MBA in Finance, MS in Computer Engineering and Manufacturing and Masters in Accountancy in Information systems. He established his own company "Xeno Systems. He however decided to come back to the homeland to serve his own people. To make his dreams a reality, he has decided to train our people with highest level of education in the I.T sector. When he launched the "Operation Badar", he was alone but now he is flanked by a strong group of his team-mates.

                        What greater or better gift can we offer to the nation than to teach and train our youth? We generally claim to have a firm belief in this proverbial saying, but the ground reality denounces these claims. Over the decades, the hopeless rate of literacy prevailing in our country fully exposes the sincerity of efforts made by our leadership in this respect. It is the harsh fact that the quality education has been segmented to the affluent class while the majority of the people have been left to suffer the complexes of "Urdu-English Medium". The nature however never leaves the vacuum unfilled and has sent a man in the form of Ziaullah Khan, a non-resident Pakistani to bridge the gap. Ziaullah Khan, a world class IT professional was living in the United States for the last 15 years. Sacrificing the glamorous living, he decided to launch an educational movement in the name of "Operation Badar" to bring the cutting edge Information Technology to the grass root level at an affordable cost in Pakistan.

                        He feels that in order to achieve the target of economic revival, the country needs human resource development through quality education. Zia says that the global proliferation of Information Technology offers tremendous economic opportunities but only to the people prone to the current trends in education.

                        Operation Badar, in fact is the right direction towards the cherished goal through human resource development by providing the opportunity to the people irrespective to the social status for the quality education. Operation Badar launched hardly a year ago received an overwhelming response, which reflects in the registration of over 10,000 students in Karachi alone.

                        In fact, Ziaullah Khan has an obsession to produce over one lakh IT professionals by broadening the network of Operation Badar in all smaller and major towns of Pakistan.

                        Currently, the area of education is facing acute shortage of qualified teachers in I.T sector. Operation Badar will produce quality professionals at a massive scale who would cater not only to the need of the trade and industry but also bridge the gap in education sector by providing highly skilled faculty staff for I.T education.

                        Operation Badar has already been introduced at 9 different educational institutions. The premises of these Universities and institutions are being utilized on off days. Operation Badar uses the premises and Lab facilities of these institutions on Sundays by conducting 4-5 classes of 3 hours each. Out of the total income 60 per cent goes to the management of the institutions and remaining 40 per cent is disbursed among the teachers. This is perhaps the first educational movement which has been launched without having any premises of its own.

                        Actually, it is the passion, which has been translated into the shape of Operation Badar. It is an obsession to spread the light of quality education to all segments of the society and to bring economic prosperity both to the people as well as the country. Interview of Ziaullah Khan is accompanied by shots of classes and labs at Institute of Management & Information Technology (IMIT), Technical Institute of Professional Development for Women (TPD) and National Institute of Emerging Technologies (NIET) at Preston University.

                        When his attention drawn towards the worldwide crisis especially in the US IT sectors, he said that although he was not an economist yet he believes that it's a temporary phase. As far as the US economy was concerned it moves in waves ups and downs, steep decline as experienced in the third world economies is not the character in USA. However it should not be our concern, we have yet to go a long way. The field is wide open and opportunities are always there for the right man and right education. Large scope for IT professionals exists even within Pakistan. Right now we are erecting the infrastructure and a strong foundation for a prestigious fort which has yet to come on the ground, he remarked.

                    <h3>Records</h3>
                    <small class="text-primary">
                        Records are generally made to be broken, but Taqi Hasan, an outstanding student of Operation Badar has set an unbreakable world record in the field of Information Technology. He has been declared as the highest scorer (100 per cent) of Sun Certified (US) Java Professional (SCJE) exams. A challenger may repeat this performance but will not be first. Afsah Shafqat, a 12-year old girl, yet another brilliant student of Operation Badar also achieved the world class performance. At her young age she achieved the touch of class being the youngest Sun Certified Java programmer of the world. Credit certainly goes to Operation Badar for the talent hunt and also for breaking all taboos such as certain level of education, grades and age etc. in vogue in our system as pre-requisites for entering the higher studies. It is unfortunate that uncalled for barriers in our education system are killing the wisdom at the cost of so called educational degrees and certificates. Operation Badar however has provided a platform to the people irrespective of their age and educational degrees to prove their worth and wisdom. The spirit reflects in the fact that over 500 students between the age of 12 and 19 are now studying in Operation Badar for juniors at Institute of Management and Information Technology under this talent hunt program. Students who will qualify in this 3 months course will be given direct admission in the regular Operation Badar program. It is worth mentioning that Afsah, the world record holder of Java programmer and her two sisters are also in the regular program.
